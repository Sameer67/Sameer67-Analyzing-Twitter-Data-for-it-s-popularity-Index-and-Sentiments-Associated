12/3/2019 11:58,@RichJLaverty For me the #Ballondor lack relevance as a ‚Äòbest footballer award‚Äô. When you look at the men‚Äôs 63 year history its been won by 1 goal keeper and 2 defenders. You simply can‚Äôt measure the ability of a defender against a goal scorer. The award would be more relevant by position.,thebattlewagon,[u'Ballondor'],100,
